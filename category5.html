                    <h1>My homeless story.</h1>
                    <p>One day I was driving home from getting dinner for my family. 
                    I was turning at a light and then I ran into a metal fence and ran over a homeless man's home. 
                    He was very mad and almost killed me.</p>

                    <h1>Homeless guy?</h1>
                    <p>
                    This guy started to walk up to me and my friend and asked for money but we 
                    didn’t want to give him any money because we didn’t know what he was going 
                    to use it for. So we gave him food instead of the money but he said he 
                    didn’t want the food he wanted the money and we said no so the guy started 
                    to throw stuff at us.
