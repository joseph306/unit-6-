                <h1>My Tweaker Story</h1>
                <p>So for your information there is a tweaker by the train station on bell road and me and my friend had
                encountered this person by accident. We were minding our own business when suddenly a man appeared out of
                nowhere and started asking if we had taken his stuff, we had just gotten to this station by the way and
                where about to get on, of course we had told him no and then he started to keep antagonizing us so we had
                just started to ignore him and get on the train.</p>

                <h1>My Tweaker Story</h1>
                <p>There was this guy that was running after me and my friend in the parking lot at walmart for no reason
                at all. The guy was wearing a red shirt and black pants. Me and my friend where just sitting in the car
                and the guy started to run after us. Then this car showed up and started to follow us around the parking
                lot to. Then we finally lost them 30 minutes later.</p>
